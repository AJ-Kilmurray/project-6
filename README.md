# Overview
Extremely basic color generator, for both HEX &amp; CSS color properties. The goal was to practice using Javascript for the second time. HTML &amp; CSS were not the focus.

## Description
After my second project, I decided to start a color generator the next day. It includes both regular colors and HEX color codes.

### What I learned about JavaScript
I learned some essential skills within this small project.

* Combining array strings to create hex codes
* Using for loops
* Using if statements
* Commenting my code
* Methods

## Things to be improved
I'm very satisfied with how my code turned out in this small project. The only thing I would change is adding more interactivity and the UI of the site. However, the purpose was to learn and focus on JavaScript without having to worry about the design of the site.
